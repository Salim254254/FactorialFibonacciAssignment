# Factorial and Fibonacci Sequence Calculator (C++)

This repository contains a C++ program that calculates the factorial of a number and the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, including runtime information for each calculation.

## Program Description
- The program uses the `<chrono>` library to measure and display the time taken for each calculation.
- Example outputs:
  - Factorial of 5: 120 (time taken: X.XXXXXX seconds)
  - Fibonacci number at position 10: 55 (time taken: X.XXXXXX seconds)

## Runtime Information
- Factorial calculation runtime varies based on input size. 
- Fibonacci calculation runtime also varies.
